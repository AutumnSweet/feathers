# How to use the Feathers `StageTextTextEditor` component

The [`StageTextTextEditor`](../api-reference/feathers/controls/text/StageTextTextEditor.html) class renders text using [`flash.text.StageText`](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/text/StageText.html).

<aside class="info">`StageTextTextEditor` is one of many different [text editors](text-editors.html) supported by the Feathers [`TextInput`](text-input.html) component. Since no method of editing text is considered definitively better than the others, Feathers allows you to choose the best text editor for your project's requirements. See [Introduction to Feathers text editors](text-editors.html) for complete details about all of the text editing options supported by Feathers.</aside>
