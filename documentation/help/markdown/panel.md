# How to use the Feathers Panel component

The `Panel` component is a container that supports layout and scrolling, similar to `ScrollContainer`, but it also adds a header and an optional footer above and below the content, respectively. This component is useful for creating windows and dialogs and making any kind of grouping that needs a header or title.

## The Basics

Let's start by creating a `Panel` and adding it to the display list:

``` code
var panel:Panel = new Panel();
this.addChild( panel );
```

A `Panel` works a lot like any `DisplayObjectContainer`, so you can use the standard `addChild()`, `removeChild()` and other display list manipulation functions.

``` code
var xPosition:Number = 0;
for(var i:int = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    var quad:Quad = new Quad( 100, 100, 0xff0000 );
    quad.x = xPosition;
    panel.addChild( quad );
    xPosition += quad.width + 10;
}
```

The children of a `Panel` do not need to be Feathers UI controls. As you can see above, we've added some Starling `Quad` instances.

By default, the `Panel` will automatically resize itself to fit the area that the children occupy (plus its header and footer). We can set the width and height manually, if desired, to override this behavior:

``` code
panel.width = 200;
panel.height = 200;
```

### The Header

By default, a panel's header sub-component is an instance of the `Header` class. However, it can be any Feathers component. The only restriction is that the header must appear on the top edge of the panel and fill the entire panel width.

You can customize the panel's header in two ways. The first way is to provide a custom header factory:

``` code
panel.headerFactory = function():Header
{
    var header:Header = new Header();
    header.title = "Tools";
    return header;
}
```

You can set any properties that you desire on the header inside this factory, including skins.

Alternatively, you could use the default header factory, which simply creates a `Header` instance, and pass in properties through the `headerProperties` object.

``` code
panel.headerProperties.title = "Tools";
```

Remember, the panel's header does not need to be a `Header` instance. It simply needs to be a Feathers component. If you wanted to make a `Panel` with a clickable header, you could provide a `headerFactory` that returns a `Button`:

``` code
panel.headerFactory = function():Button
{
    var button:Button = new Button();
    button.label = "Tools";
    button.addEventListener( Event.TRIGGERED, panelHeaderButton_triggeredHandler );
    return button;
}
```

That might be useful for creating a panel that can collapse and expand.

In general, you should only skins to the panel's header through `headerProperties` if you need to change skins after the header is created. Using `headerFactory` will provide slightly better performance, and your development environment will be able to provide code hinting thanks to stronger typing.

### The Footer

By default, a panel doesn't have a footer. However, if you want to add a footer, it may be any Feathers component. The only restriction is that the footer must appear on the bottom edge of the panel and fill the entire panel width.

You can customize the panel's footer in two ways. The first way is to provide a custom footer factory:

``` code
panel.footerFactory = function():ScrollContainer
{
    var container:ScrollContainer = new ScrollContainer();
    container.styleNameList.add( ScrollContainer.ALTERNATE_NAME_TOOLBAR );
    container.horizontalScrollPolicy = ScrollContainer.SCROLL_POLICY_OFF;
    container.verticalScrollPolicy = ScrollContainer.SCROLL_POLICY_OFF;
    return container;
}
```

You can set any properties that you desire on the footer inside this factory, including skins. In this example, we're using a scroll container with a “toolbar” alternate name that usually makes it look similar to a `Panel` component's `Header` and usually gives it a horizontal layout (the exact behavior depends on the theme, but this is the most common behavior).

Alternatively, you could use a simple footer factory that sets no properties, and pass in properties through the `headerProperties` object.

``` code
panel.footerProperties.horizontalScrollPolicy = ScrollContainer.SCROLL_POLICY_OFF;
panel.footerProperties.verticalScrollPolicy = ScrollContainer.SCROLL_POLICY_OFF;
```

In general, you should only skins to the panel's footer through `footerProperties` if you need to change properties or skins after the footer is created. Using `footerFactory` will provide slightly better performance, and your development environment will be able to provide code hinting thanks to stronger typing.

## Layout

We manually positioned the quads in the example code above. Instead, let's apply a [HorizontalLayout](http://feathersui.com/documentation/feathers/layout/HorizontalLayout.html) to the children of a `Panel` to do the positioning manually:

``` code
var layout:HorizontalLayout = new HorizontalLayout();
layout.gap = 10;
panel.layout = layout;
```

We can set a number of other properties on the layout too. In the case of `HorizontalLayout` (and `VerticalLayout` too), we can customize things like padding around the edges along with horizontal and vertical alignment. Other layouts may expose more or completely different properties that may be customized. Check their API documentation for complete details.

## Skinning a Panel

The skins for a `Panel` control are divided into the header, the content, and the footer. Additionally, a panel may have background skins and various other styles. For full details about what skin and style properties are available, see the [Panel API reference](http://feathersui.com/documentation/feathers/controls/Panel.html). We'll look at a few of the most common properties below.

### Background Skins and Basic Styles

We'll start the skinning process by giving our panel appropriate background skins.

``` code
panel.backgroundSkin = new Scale9Image( enabledTextures );
panel.backgroundDisabledSkin = new Image( disabledTextures );
```

The `backgroundSkin` property provides the default background for when the panel is enabled. The `backgroundDisabledSkin` is displayed when the panel is disabled. If the `backgroundDisabledSkin` isn't provided to a disabled panel, it will fall back to using the `backgroundSkin` in the disabled state.

Padding may be added around the edges of the panel's content. This padding is different than any type of padding that may be provided by the layout. The layout padding is applied inside the panel's content, but the panel's padding is applied outside of the content, and is generally used to show a bit of the background as a border around the content.

``` code
panel.paddingTop = 15;
panel.paddingRight = 20;
panel.paddingBottom = 15;
panel.paddingLeft = 20;
```

If all four padding values should be the same, you may use the `padding` property to quickly set them all at once:

``` code
panel.padding = 20;
```

### Targeting a Panel in a theme

If you are creating a [theme](themes.html), you can set a function for the default styles like this:

``` code
getStyleProviderForClass( Panel ).defaultStyleFunction = setPanelStyles;
```

If you want to customize a specific panel to look different than the default, you may use a custom style name to call a different function:

``` code
panel.styleNameList.add( "custom-panel" );
```

You can specify the function for the custom style name like this:

``` code
getStyleProviderForClass( Panel )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( "custom-panel", setCustomPanelStyles );
```

Trying to change the panel's styles and skins outside of the theme may result in the theme overriding the properties, if you set them before the panel was added to the stage and initialized. Learn to [extend an existing theme](extending-themes.html) to add custom skins.

If you aren't using a theme, then you may set any of the panel's properties directly.

### Skinning the Header

This section only explains how to access the header sub-component. The header may be any type of Feathers control. Please read the appropriate documentation for full details about the skinning properties that are available on the component that is used for the header.
For the default header, please read [How to use the Feathers Header component](header.html) for full details about the skinning properties that are available on `Header` components.

#### With a Theme

If you're creating a [theme](themes.html), you can target the `Panel.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_HEADER` style name.

``` code
getStyleProviderForClass( Header )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( Panel.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_HEADER, setPanelHeaderStyles );
```

You can override the default style name to use a different one in your theme, if you prefer:

``` code
panel.customHeaderName = "custom-header";
```

You can set the function for the `customHeaderName` like this:

``` code
getStyleProviderForClass( Header )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( "custom-header", setPanelCustomHeaderStyles );
```

#### Without a Theme

If you are not using a theme, you can use `headerFactory` to provide skins for the panel's header:

``` code
panel.headerFactory = function():Header
{
    var header:Header = new Header();
    //skin the header here
    header.backgroundSkin = new Scale9Image( headerBackgroundTextures );
    return header;
}
```

Alternatively, or in addition to the `headerFactory`, you may use the `headerProperties` to pass skins to the header.

``` code
panel.headerProperties.backgroundSkin = new Scale9Image( headerBackgroundTextures );
```

In general, you should only pass skins to the panel's header through `headerProperties` if you need to change skins after the header is created. Using `headerFactory` will provide slightly better performance, and your development environment will be able to provide code hinting thanks to stronger typing.

### Skinning the Footer

This section only explains how to access the footer sub-component. The footer may be any type of Feathers control. Please read the appropriate documentation for full details about the skinning properties that are available on the component that is used for the footer.

#### With a Theme

If you're creating a [theme](themes.html), you can target the `Panel.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_FOOTER` style name. In the following example, we'll assume that the footer is a `ScrollContainer`, but it could be any type of Feathers component.

``` code
getStyleProviderForClass( ScrollContainer )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( Panel.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_FOOTER, setPanelFooterStyles );
```

You can override the default style name to use a different one in your theme, if you prefer:

``` code
panel.customFooterName = "custom-footer";
```

You can set the function for the `customFooterName` like this:

``` code
getStyleProviderForClass( ScrollContainer )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( "custom-footer", setPanelCustomFooterStyles );
```

#### Without a Theme

If you are not using a theme, you can use `footerFactory` to provide skins for the panel's footer:

``` code
panel.footerFactory = function():ScrollContainer
{
    var footer:ScrollContainer = new ScrollContainer();
    //skin the footer here
    footer.backgroundSkin = new Scale9Image( footerBackgroundTextures );
    return footer;
}
```

Alternatively, or in addition to the `footerFactory`, you may use the `footerProperties` to pass skins to the footer.

``` code
panel.footerProperties.backgroundSkin = new Scale9Image( footerBackgroundTextures );
```

In general, you should only pass skins to the panel's footer through `footerProperties` if you need to change skins after the footer is created. Using `footerFactory` will provide slightly better performance, and your development environment will be able to provide code hinting thanks to stronger typing.

### Skinning the Scroll Bars

This section only explains how to access the horizontal scroll bar and vertical scroll bar sub-components. Please read [How to use the Feathers ScrollBar component](scroll-bar.html) (or [SimpleScrollBar](simple-scroll-bar.html)) for full details about the skinning properties that are available on scroll bar components.

#### With a Theme

If you're creating a [theme](themes.html), you can target the `Scroller.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_HORIZONTAL_SCROLL_BAR` style name for the horizontal scroll bar and the `Scroller.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_VERTICAL_SCROLL_BAR` style name for the vertical scroll bar.

``` code
getStyleProviderForClass( ScrollBar )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( Scroller.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_HORIZONTAL_SCROLL_BAR, setHorizontalScrollBarStyles );
getStyleProviderForClass( ScrollBar )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( Scroller.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_VERTICAL_SCROLL_BAR, setVerticalScrollBarStyles );
```

You can override the default style names to use different ones in your theme, if you prefer:

``` code
panel.customHorizontalScrollBarName = "custom-horizontal-scroll-bar";
panel.customVerticalScrollBarName = "custom-vertical-scroll-bar";
```

You can set the function for the `customHorizontalScrollBarName` and the `customVerticalScrollBarName` like this:

``` code
getStyleProviderForClass( ScrollBar )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( "custom-horizontal-scroll-bar", setCustomHorizontalScrollBarStyles );
getStyleProviderForClass( ScrollBar )
    .setFunctionForStyleName( "custom-vertical-scroll-bar", setCustomVerticalScrollBarStyles,  );
```

#### Without a Theme

If you are not using a theme, you can use `horizontalScrollBarFactory` and `verticalScrollBarFactory` to provide skins for the panel's scroll bars:

``` code
panel.horizontalScrollBarFactory = function():ScrollBar
{
    var scrollBar:ScrollBar = new ScrollBar();
    //skin the scroll bar here
    scrollBar.trackLayoutMode = ScrollBar.TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_SINGLE;
    return scrollBar;
}
```

Alternatively, or in addition to the `horizontalScrollBarFactory` and `verticalScrollBarFactory`, you may use the `horizontalScrollBarProperties` and the `verticalScrollBarProperties` to pass skins to the scroll bars.

``` code
panel.horizontalScrollBarProperties.trackLayoutMode = ScrollBar.TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_SINGLE;
```

In general, you should only pass skins to the panel's scroll bars through `horizontalScrollBarProperties` and `verticalScrollBarProperties` if you need to change skins after the scroll bar is created. Using `horizontalScrollBarFactory` and `verticalScrollBarFactory` will provide slightly better performance, and your development environment will be able to provide code hinting thanks to stronger typing.

## Customizing Scrolling Behavior

A number of properties are available to customize scrolling behavior and the scroll bars.

### Interaction Modes

Panels provide two main scrolling interaction modes, which can be changed using the `interactionMode` property.

By default, you can scroll using touch, just like you would on many mobile devices including smartphones and tablets. This mode allows you to grab the panel anywhere within its bounds and drag it around to scroll. This mode is defined by the constant, `INTERACTION_MODE_TOUCH`.

Alternatively, you can set `interactionMode` to `INTERACTION_MODE_MOUSE`. This mode allows you to scroll using the horizontal or vertical scroll bar sub-components. You can also use the mouse wheel to scroll vertically.

### Scroll Bar Display Mode

The `scrollBarDisplayMode` property controls how and when scroll bars are displayed. This value may be overridden by the scroll policy, as explained below.

The default value is `SCROLL_BAR_DISPLAY_MODE_FLOAT`, which displays the scroll bars above the view port's content, rather than affecting the size of the view port. When the scroll bars are floating, they fade out when the panel is not actively scrolling. This is a familiar behavior for scroll bars in the touch interaction mode. In the mouse interaction mode, the scroll bars will appear when the mouse hovers over them and then disappear when the hover ends.

To completely hide the scroll bars, but still allow scrolling, you can set `scrollBarDisplayMode` to `SCROLL_BAR_DISPLAY_MODE_NONE`.

Finally, if you want the scroll bars to always be visible outside of the content in a fixed position, you can set `scrollBarDisplayMode` to `SCROLL_BAR_DISPLAY_MODE_FIXED`. This is best for traditional desktop scrollable content.

### Scroll Policies

The two previous properties control how scrolling works. The `horizontalScrollPolicy` and `verticalScrollPolicy` properties control whether scrolling is enabled or not.

The default scroll policy for both directions is `SCROLL_POLICY_AUTO`. If the content's width is greater than the view port's width, the panel may scroll horizontally (same for height and vertical scrolling). If not, then the panel will not scroll in that direction. In addition to the `scrollBarDisplayMode`, this can affect whether the scroll bar is visible or not.

You can completely disable scrolling in either direction, set the scroll policy to `SCROLL_POLICY_OFF`. The scroll bar will not be visible, and the panel won't scroll, even if the content is larger than the view port.

Finally, you can ensure that scrolling is always enabled by setting the scroll policy to `SCROLL_POLICY_ON`. If combined with `hasElasticEdges` in the touch interaction mode, it will create a playful edge that always bounces back, even when the content is smaller than the view port. If using the mouse interaction mode, the scroll bar may always be visible under the same circumstances, though it may be disabled if the content is smaller than the view port.

### Paging

Set the `snapToPages` property to true to make the panel snap to the nearest full page. A page is defined as a multiple of the view ports width or height. If the view port is 100 pixels wide, then the first horizontal page starts at 0 pixels, the second at 100, and the third at 200.

The `pageWidth` and `pageHeight` properties may be used to customize the size of a page. Rather than using the full view port width or height, any pixel value may be specified for page snapping.
