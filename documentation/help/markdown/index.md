# Feathers

Say hello to [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/). Light-weight, skinnable, and extensible UI components for mobile and desktop. Feathers puts it all together in one package â€” along with blazing fast GPU powered graphics (courtesy of Starling Framework) to create a smooth and responsive experience.

Feathers is free and open source. Feathers runs on Starling Framework and the Adobe Flash runtimes, including Adobe AIR on iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS X and Adobe Flash Player in desktop browsers.

## Platform UI Guidelines

Please take a look at the official documentation linked below for the platforms that Feathers supports. Become familiar with the guidelines for each platform, and try to tailor your application's experience to the specific platform that your code is running on at any given moment. Cross-platform user interface libraries like Feathers can be convenient and powerful, but do not forget that you are responsible for meeting the expectations of your users on each platform. One size rarely fits all.
