<div class="level1">

<p>
This is the code formatting style used within the <a href="/feathers/start" class="wikilink1" title="feathers:start">Feathers</a> library. When contributing code to Feathers, you are required to use this style. Pull Requests to the <a href="https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers" class="urlextern" title="https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers"  rel="nofollow">Feathers project on Github</a> that are formatted with a different style will be rejected. The author respects that you may have your own personal style, and the author would attempt to follow your style if he were to contribute to your open source project. Save him some time so that he doesn&#039;t need to manually reformat your contributed code.
</p>

<p>
If you are not contributing code to Feathers, then please feel no obligation to follow this style guide when working with the library. This guide is aimed at developers who wish to contribute bug fixes and enhancements to Feathers.
</p>

<p>
The terms “public” and “private” are used below in a general sense. When the specific <code>public</code> or <code>private</code> namespace is referenced, it will be clearly styled. When not marked as a namespace, public refers to any <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> that is meant to be exposed to someone using a particular class. It may include things like <code>public</code> members and <code>protected</code> members that are meant to be accessed in subclasses. Similarly, private refers to APIs that are meant to be used only internally. Private APIs may be part of the <code>protected</code> namespace, but using these APIs in subclasses is an at-your-own-risk convenience only.
