<div class="level1">

<p>
Subclasses shouldn&#039;t necessarily have the same skins as their superclass. For instance, DefaultListItemRenderer and Check both extend Button, but they don&#039;t look very much like buttons. If you want a subclass to have the same skins as its superclass, you should <a href="/feathers/extending-themes" class="wikilink1" title="feathers:extending-themes">extend the theme</a> and tell it to use the same initializer function for the subclass that is defined for the superclass.
