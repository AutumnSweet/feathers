<p><div class="notewarning">
Flash Professional&#039;s ability to properly simulate devices on AIR is limited compared to other development environments. Flash Professional&#039;s AIR simulator does not provide the correct screen DPI/PPI for the mobile device that it is simulating. The value of <code>Capabilities.screenDPI</code> is used by Feathers themes to scale skins to an appropriate physical size for each device. In order to use the DPI scaling capabilities of Feathers themes, you will need to run <strong>ADL</strong> from the AIR SDK on the command line or test on a real device.
