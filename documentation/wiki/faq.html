<div class="level3">

<p>
Feathers is designed and developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/joshtynjala" class="urlextern" title="https://twitter.com/joshtynjala"  rel="nofollow">Josh Tynjala</a>, a veteran software developer who has been working in the Flash ecosystem for over a decade. He has years of experience developing custom Flash UI components, and he has built many apps with Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR for web, desktop, and mobile.
</p>

<p>
Feathers originated during a time when Josh was developing mobile games for iOS and Android with Adobe AIR. Josh needed UI components that offered excellent performance, touch-centric behavior, and flexible skinning options. None of the Flash UI frameworks at the time were optimized for mobile, and everything was designed for a keyboard and mouse instead of touch screens. He needed to start fresh, focusing on mobile first.
</p>

<p>
Before long, Josh released Feathers as an open source project. The project soon gained the attention of Adobe, and Josh continues to expand the Feathers library with the company&#039;s support.

Though Feathers is an independent open source project, development of Feathers is supported by Adobe. As a first step in this partnership, Feathers is included with the <a href="http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/gamingsdk/" class="urlextern" title="http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/gamingsdk/"  rel="nofollow">Adobe Gaming SDK</a>, along with Starling Framework and other tools for developing games with Adobe technologies.

Feathers uses <a href="http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/" class="urlextern" title="http://gaming.adobe.com/technologies/"  rel="nofollow">Adobe AIR</a>, which can create completely standalone, native apps on iOS, Android (including Barnes &amp; Noble&#039;s NOOK devices, Amazon&#039;s Kindle devices, and the OUYA console), Windows, and Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> X.

<div class="level3">

<p>
Not anymore. Adobe AIR&#039;s <em>captive runtime</em> feature lets you bundle everything you need into one package. It makes your app&#039;s install size a little bit bigger, but this isn&#039;t any different than linking in third party frameworks for graphics, audio, and scripting that you might need to build any kind of native app.
</p>

<p>
If you prefer to use the separate runtime that Adobe provides, that&#039;s remains an option too. iOS support always requires the captive runtime, due to Apple&#039;s rules for distributing apps in their App Store.

<div class="level3">

<p>
Ideally, I&#039;d love to provide a basic set of skins for all components that get applied automatically. However, there are some important considerations for optimizing texture atlases for the GPU, mobile performance and memory limits, and the inevitable customizations that are required for just about every app. These considerations often aren&#039;t present in a software-based UI framework due to how much easier it is to draw dynamic shapes at runtime in software than it is in hardware.

Have you provided skins for the component? The Feathers components don&#039;t have default skins. Default skins would add unnecessary extra filesize to your projects and they wouldn&#039;t be very styleable due to the bitmap-centric nature of GPUs. On mobile, every byte counts (especially since Adobe AIR&#039;s captive runtime is rather large), and forcing every Feathers app to include a texture atlas for a default skin would be too much of a burden for many developers.

<p>
You can call <code>component.validate()</code> to force a component to immediately measure itself and handle changes to its properties. Normally, a component will queue up a number of changes and process them all in one batch right before Starling renders a new frame.

<p>
Drawing text in the GPU involves many tradeoffs. Sometimes it is impossible to avoid extra draw calls. Sometimes, you can get increased performance in situations that require more draw calls. Feathers has been tuned to get the best performance most of the time, but there are options to control this behavior, if needed.

Additionally, lists will reuse item renderers when they scroll off screen to display different data that has scrolled on screen. This provides a significant performance boost, especially on mobile. When you create a custom item renderer, you need to ensure that it is designed to properly update when the list asks it to display a different item from the data provider.

<div class="level3">

<p>
Unfortunately, <code>flash.text.TextField</code> often does not draw correctly <code>BitmapData</code> until a frame later. If you are using the Feathers <code>TextFieldTextRenderer</code>, it will wait a frame before uploading its text as a texture on the GPU. Since flattening happens immediately, the TextField won&#039;t be ready in time. The best workaround is to immediately validate the component and wait a frame before flattening.

<p>
Subclasses shouldn&#039;t necessarily have the same skins as their superclass, and you will need to tell the theme that it should apply the same skins to the subclass as its superclass.

<div class="level3">

<p>
This is actually something common that happens on GPUs when you position textures on non-integer pixels or if you scale the textures. If you use TexturePacker to create your texture atlases, you can use the “extrude” setting to work around this issue. The <code><a href="/feathers/tiled-image" class="wikilink1" title="feathers:tiled-image">TiledImage</a></code> documentation has a detailed explaination of this issue and the extrude workaround.
